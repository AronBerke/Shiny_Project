# VaccineAEs_ShinyProject

## Introduction
My first project at NYC Data Science Academy examines and visualizes data on adverse events (i.e. bad reactions) to vaccines reported to the FDA/CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. Data from 2014-2018 is examined. The primary research question addressed is whether the resurgence of the anti-vacctination movement in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election affected adverse event reporting trends, and whether there was any other noticeable reporting patterns. 

## Creation
This code was written by Aron Berke to be used for non-commercial (academic in nature) purposes.

## Layout
Data for each year is retrieved separately, and contains three separate tables linked by a common id. The 'Loading_and_Cleaning' R file contains code for cleaning and merging the separate tables and years. The Shiny_App folder contains the code for the app's UI and backend data processing
